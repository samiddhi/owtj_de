„Ebenso, o Brahmane, wenn der Tathāgata einen Menschen, der zu zähmen ist, in seine Obhut bekommt, unterweist er ihn zuallererst folgendermaßen: ‚Komm, Mönch, sei sittenrein. Lebe, eingeschränkt durch die Ordensregeln, vollkommen im Verhalten und im rechten Wandel, siehst du die Gefahr schon im geringsten Vergehen. Indem du sie übernommen hast, übe dich in den Übungsregeln.‘

Wenn der Mönch, o Brahmane, sittenrein ist, [...] sieht er die Gefahr schon im geringsten Vergehen, dann unterweist ihn der Tathāgata weiter: ‚Komm, Mönch, sei einer, der die Tore der Sinne bewacht. Wenn du mit dem Auge eine Form erblickst, sei einer, der nicht am Anzeichen haftet, nicht am Detail. Denn wenn du unbezähmt mit dem Auge lebst, könnten üble, unheilsame Geisteszustände, Begierde und Widerwille, in dich einströmen. Daher übe dich in deren Bezähmung; bewache das Auge, erlange die Bezähmung des Auges. Wenn du mit dem Ohr einen Ton hörst [...] Wenn du mit der Nase einen Duft riechst [...] Wenn du mit der Zunge einen Geschmack schmeckst [...] Wenn du mit dem Körper eine Berührung fühlst [...] Wenn du mit dem Geist ein Geistesobjekt wahrnimmst, sei einer, der nicht am Anzeichen haftet, nicht am Detail. Denn wenn du unbezähmt mit dem Geist lebst, könnten üble, unheilsame Geisteszustände, Begierde und Widerwille, in dich einströmen. Daher übe dich in deren Bezähmung; bewache den Geist, erlange die Bezähmung des Geistes.‘

Wenn der Mönch, o Brahmane, einer ist, der die Tore der Sinne bewacht, dann unterweist ihn der Tathāgata weiter: ‚Komm, Mönch, sei maßvoll beim Essen. Indem du weise reflektierst, nimmst du Speise zu dir: nicht zum Vergnügen, nicht zum Rausch, nicht zur Zierde, nicht zur Verschönerung, sondern einzig um diesen Körper am Leben zu erhalten, um Schaden zu beenden, um das heilige Leben zu unterstützen, indem du denkst: So werde ich altes Gefühl beenden und kein neues Gefühl aufsteigen lassen, und ich werde ein untadeliges Leben führen und mich wohl fühlen.‘

Wenn der Mönch, o Brahmane, maßvoll beim Essen ist, dann unterweist ihn der Tathāgata weiter: ‚Komm, Mönch, sei einer, der sich der Wachsamkeit widmet. Am Tage, beim Gehen und Sitzen, läutere deinen Geist von hemmenden Zuständen. In der ersten Nachtwache, beim Gehen und Sitzen, läutere deinen Geist von hemmenden Zuständen. In der mittleren Nachtwache, bereite dir auf der rechten Seite das Löwenlager, einen Fuß über dem anderen, achtsam und wissensklar, die Vorstellung des Aufstehens im Geiste haltend. In der letzten Nachtwache, erhebe dich und läutere beim Gehen und Sitzen deinen Geist von hemmenden Zuständen.‘

Wenn der Mönch, o Brahmane, einer ist, der sich der Wachsamkeit widmet, dann unterweist ihn der Tathāgata weiter: ‚Komm, Mönch, sei einer, der mit Achtsamkeit und Wissensklarheit ausgestattet ist. Handle wissensklar beim Hingehen und Zurückkehren; beim Hinblicken und Wegblicken; beim Beugen und Strecken der Glieder; beim Tragen der Ober- und Unterrobe, der Almosenschale; beim Essen, Trinken, Kauen und Schmecken; beim Verrichten der Notdurft; beim Gehen, Stehen, Sitzen, Einschlafen, Aufwachen, Reden und Schweigen.‘

Wenn der Mönch, o Brahmane, einer ist, der mit Achtsamkeit und Wissensklarheit ausgestattet ist, dann unterweist ihn der Tathāgata weiter: ‚Komm, Mönch, suche eine abgeschiedene Lagerstätte auf: einen Wald, den Fuß eines Baumes, einen Berg, eine Schlucht, eine Berghöhle, einen Leichenacker, ein Walddickicht, eine freie Fläche, einen Strohhaufen.‘

Er sucht eine abgeschiedene Lagerstätte auf: einen Wald, den Fuß eines Baumes, einen Berg, eine Schlucht, eine Berghöhle, einen Leichenacker, ein Walddickicht, eine freie Fläche, einen Strohhaufen. Nach dem Almosengang, nach der Mahlzeit, setzt er sich mit gekreuzten Beinen nieder, den Oberkörper aufgerichtet, und richtet die Achtsamkeit nach vorn, auf den Gegenwartspunkt.

Nachdem er Begierde gegenüber der Welt aufgegeben hat, verweilt er mit einem von Begierde freien Geist; er läutert seinen Geist von Begierde. Nachdem er Übelwollen und Hass aufgegeben hat, verweilt er mit einem von Übelwollen freien Geist, voll Mitgefühl für das Wohlergehen aller lebenden Wesen; er läutert seinen Geist von Übelwollen und Hass. Nachdem er Trägheit und Mattheit aufgegeben hat, verweilt er frei von Trägheit und Mattheit, voll Wahrnehmung von Licht, achtsam und wissensklar; er läutert seinen Geist von Trägheit und Mattheit. Nachdem er Rastlosigkeit und Gewissensunruhe aufgegeben hat, verweilt er unaufgeregt, mit einem innerlich beruhigten Geist; er läutert seinen Geist von Rastlosigkeit und Gewissensunruhe. Nachdem er den Zweifel aufgegeben hat, verweilt er dem Zweifel entronnen, ohne Ungewissheit heilsamen Geisteszuständen gegenüber; er läutert seinen Geist von Zweifel.

Nachdem er diese fünf Hemmnisse aufgegeben hat, diese Befleckungen des Geistes, die die Weisheit schwächen, dann, ganz abgeschieden von Sinnesreizen, abgeschieden von unheilsamen Geisteszuständen, tritt er in die erste Vertiefung ein, die mit Denken und Überlegen geboren wird, mit Verzückung und Glücksgefühl, die aus der Abgeschiedenheit entstanden ist, und verweilt in ihr. Mit der Stillung von Denken und Überlegen tritt er in die zweite Vertiefung ein, die innere Beruhigung und Einheit des Gemüts ohne Denken und Überlegen, mit Verzückung und Glücksgefühl, die aus der Sammlung entstanden sind, und verweilt in ihr. Nach dem Verblassen der Verzückung, in Gleichmut verweilend, achtsam und wissensklar, voll körperlich empfundenen Glücks, tritt er in die dritte Vertiefung ein, von der die Edlen sagen: ‚Glückselig verweilt derjenige, der voll Gleichmut und Achtsamkeit ist‘, und verweilt in ihr. Nach dem Überwinden von Glück und Schmerz und dem schon früheren Schwinden von Frohsinn und Trauer, tritt er in die vierte Vertiefung ein, die aufgrund von Gleichmut und Achtsamkeit Läuterung ist, weder Schmerz noch Glück, und verweilt in ihr.

Jenen Mönchen, o Brahmane, die Lehrlinge sind, die das Ziel noch nicht erreicht haben und unermüdlich im Streben nach dem höchsten Heil von der Fessel verweilen, gilt diese meine Unterweisung. Doch jenen Mönchen, die Arahants sind, deren Triebe vernichtet sind, die das heilige Leben gelebt, getan was getan werden musste, die Bürde abgelegt, das wahre Ziel erreicht haben, deren Daseinsfesseln völlig zerstört und die durch vollkommene Erkenntnis befreit sind, – diese Dinge führen bei ihnen zu einem gegenwärtig glücklichen Verweilen und zu Achtsamkeit und Wissensklarheit.“

… When the Tathāgata gets a person fit to be tamed, he first trains him
like this:
‘(1) Come, monk. Be virtuous. Live restrained in accordance with
the Pāṭimokkha, accomplished in your behavior and sphere of activity.
Train yourself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in
the slightest faults.’
When the monk is virtuous … seeing danger in the slightest faults,
the Tathāgata then trains him further:
‘(2) Come, monk. Be one who is guarded in the doors of your sense
faculties. On seeing a form with the eye, don’t grasp at any signs and
features (significance) by which—if you were to live without restraint
over the faculty of the eye—unskilful qualities such as greed or distress
might assail you. Practice restraint. Protect the faculty of the eye.
Attain restraint concerning the faculty of the eye. On hearing a sound
with the ear … On smelling an aroma with the nose … On tasting a
flavour with the tongue … On touching a tactile sensation with the
body … On cognising an idea with the intellect, don’t grasp at any signs
and features by which—if you were to live without restraint over the
faculty of the intellect—unskilful qualities such as greed or distress
might assail you. Practice restraint. Protect the faculty of the intellect.
Attain restraint concerning the faculty of the intellect.’
When the monk is one who is guarded in the doors of his sense
faculties … the Tathāgata then trains him further:
‘(3) Come, monk. Be one who moderates his eating. Concurrently
reflecting, take your food not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for
putting on weight, nor for beautification, but simply for the survival and
continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the
holy life, thinking, “I will destroy old feelings and not create new feelings.
Therefore I will maintain myself, be blameless and live at ease.’
When the monk is one who moderates his eating … the Tathāgata
then trains him further:

‘(4) Come, monk. Be one who is devoted to wakefulness. During
the day, sitting and walking back and forth, cleanse your mind of
obstructive things. During the first watch of the night, sitting and
walking back and forth, cleanse your mind of obstructive things.
During the second watch of the night, reclining on your right side,
take up the lion’s posture, one foot placed on top of the other,
recollected, alert, with your mind set on getting up. During the last
watch of the night, sitting and walking back and forth, cleanse your
mind of obstructive things.’
When the monk is one who is devoted to wakefulness … the
Tathāgata then trains him further:
‘(5) Come, monk. Be one who is possessed of recollection and
awareness. When going forward and returning, make yourself
aware. When looking toward and looking away … When bending and
extending your limbs … When carrying your outer cloak, upper robe,
and bowl … When eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting … When
urinating and defecating … When walking, standing, sitting, falling
asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, make yourself aware.’
When the monk is one who is possessed of recollection and
awareness … The Tathāgata then trains him further:
‘(6) Come, monk. Seek out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the
shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a
forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw.’
He seeks out a secluded residence: a wilderness, the shade of a tree,
a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove,
the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms
round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body upright, and
brings recollection to the fore.
(7) Abandoning lust with regard to the world, he lives with an
awareness devoid of lust. He cleanses his mind of lust. Abandoning
ill will and anger, he lives with an awareness devoid of ill will,
compassionate to the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind
of ill will and anger. Abandoning indolence and tiredness, he lives
with an awareness devoid of indolence and tiredness, recollected,
alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of indolence and
tiredness. Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he lives undisturbed,
his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and
anxiety. Abandoning doubt, he lives having crossed over doubt, with
no perplexity with regard to skilful qualities. He cleanses his mind of
doubt.
(8) having abandoned these five hindrances—imperfections of
mind that weaken discernment—then, withdrawn from sensual
desire, withdrawn from unskilful qualities, he enters and remains
in the first comprehension: joy and pleasure born of withdrawal,
with thinking and pondering … the second comprehension, the third
comprehension, the fourth comprehension: purity of equanimity and
recollection, neither pleasure nor pain.
This is my instruction to those monks in training who have not
attained the goal, but remain intent on the unsurpassed safety from
bondage. But for those monks who are arahants—whose defilements
are ended, who have reached fulfillment
–
done the task, laid down
the burden, attained the true goal, laid to waste the impediment of
being, and who are released through right understanding—these
qualities lead both to a pleasant abiding in the here and now, and to
recollection and awareness.

desire arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of sensual desire
has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to others’ affliction,
and to the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties,
and leads away from Nibbāna.’ When i considered: ‘This leads to my

Then Ven. Ānanda, together with Tapussa the householder, went to
the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to
one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: ‘Tapussa
the householder, here, has said to me, “Venerable Ānanda, sir, we
are householders who indulge in sensuality, delight in sensuality,
enjoy sensuality, rejoice in sensuality. For us—indulging in sensuality,
delighting in sensuality, enjoying sensuality, rejoicing in sensuality—
renunciation seems like a sheer drop-off. Yet I’ve heard that in
this teaching and discipline the minds of young monks leap up at
renunciation, grow confident, steadfast, and firm, seeing it as peace.
So right here is where this teaching and discipline is contrary to the
great mass of people: i.e. renunciation.”’
‘So it is, Ānanda. So it is.
Even I myself, before my awakening, when I was still unawakened
but intent upon awakening, thought: “Renunciation is good. Seclusion
is good.” But my mind didn’t leap up at renunciation, didn’t grow
confident, steadfast, or firm, seeing it as peace. The thought occurred
to me: “What is the cause, what is the reason, why my mind doesn’t
leap up at renunciation, doesn’t grow confident, steadfast, or firm,
seeing it as peace?” Then the thought occurred to me:
“i haven’t
seen the danger of sensual pleasures; I haven’t pursued it. I haven’t
understood the reward of renunciation; I haven’t developed it. That’s
why my mind doesn’t leap up at renunciation, doesn’t grow confident,
steadfast, or firm, seeing it as peace.”
Then the thought occurred to me: “If, having seen the danger of
sensual pleasures, I were to pursue that; and if, having understood the
reward of renunciation, I were to develop it, there’s the possibility that
my mind would leap up at renunciation, grow confident, steadfast, and
firm, seeing it as peace.” So at a later time, having seen the danger of
sensual pleasures, I pursued that theme; having understood the reward
of renunciation, I familiarized myself with it. My mind leaped up at
renunciation, grew confident, steadfast, and firm, seeing it as peace.
Then, withdrawn from sensual desires, withdrawn from
unwholesome states, i entered and remained in the first
comprehension: pleasure and happiness born from withdrawal, with
thinking and pondering.’

Then the Lord talked a progressive talk to the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika, that is to say talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on
heaven, he explained the danger, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures
of the senses, the advantage in renouncing them. When the Lord knew
that the mind of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was ready, malleable,
devoid of the hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him
that teaching on Dhamma which the awakened ones have themselves
discovered: suffering, the origin, the cessation and the way leading to
cessation of suffering. And as a clean cloth without black specks will
easily take dye, even so as he was sitting on that very seat, Dhamma-
vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika,
that ‘whatever is liable to manifest, all that is liable to cease’. Then the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having viewed the Dhamma, reached the
Dhamma, found the Dhamma, plunged into Dhamma, having crossed
over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having become independent
of others in the Teacher’s instruction.

… Aggivessana, it’s as if there were a great mountain and two
companions would go to that mountain. On arrival, one of the
companions would stay at the foot of the mountain, and one would
climb to the top. The companion staying at the foot of the mountain
would ask the companion standing on top, ‘What do you see, my

He would say, ‘I see delightful parks, delightful forests, delightful
stretches of land, and delightful lakes.’
The other would say, ‘It’s impossible, my friend. It cannot happen
that standing on top of the mountain you would see delightful parks,
delightful forests, delightful stretches of land, & delightful lakes.’
Then the companion standing on top, descending to the foot of the
mountain and grabbing his companion by the arm, would make him
climb to the top. After letting him catch his breath for a moment, he
would ask him, ‘What do you see, my friend, standing on top of the

He would say, ‘I see delightful parks, delightful forests, delightful

The other would say, ‘But just now didn’t you say, “It’s impossible,

The other would say, ‘But that’s because I was standing blocked by
this great mountain and didn’t see.’
In the same way, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is blocked,
obstructed, impeded, and enveloped by the even greater mass of
ignorance. For him, living amid sensuality, enjoying sensuality,
consumed by thoughts of sensuality, burning with the fever of
sensuality, intent on the search for sensuality, to know or see or
realize that which is to be known through renunciation, seen through
renunciation, attained through renunciation, realized through
renunciation: That is impossible. …

Once, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named
Vebhaliṅga. it was prosperous and full of people. And Kassapa, a
blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported
by Vebhaliṅga. it was here, in fact, that he had his monastery, where
he sat and advised the mendicant Saṅgha.
The Buddha Kassapa had as a chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a
potter named Ghaṭīkāra. Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla, a
brahmin student.
Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to
see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha. For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One.’ When he said
this, Jotipāla said to him,
‘Enough, what’s the use of seeing that bald,
fake ascetic?’
For a second time … and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,
‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I regard it as holy to
see that Blessed One.’ for a third time, Jotipāla said to him,
‘Enough,
what’s the use of seeing that bald, fake ascetic?’
–
‘Well then, Jotipāla,
let’s take some bathing paste of powdered shell and go to the river to
bathe.’
–
‘Yes’ replied Jotipāla.
So that’s what they did. Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Jotipāla,
the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away. let’s go to see the
Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One.’ When he said this,
Jotipāla said to him,
‘Enough, what’s the use of seeing that bald, fake
ascetic?’
For a second time … and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,
‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.
Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One.’ For a
third time, Jotipāla said to him,
‘Enough, what’s the use of seeing that
bald, fake ascetic?’
Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the belt and repeated his
request. … So Jotipāla undid his belt and said to Ghaṭīkāra,
‘Enough,
what’s the use of seeing that bald, fake ascetic?’
Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshly-washed
head repeated his request. …
Then Jotipāla thought,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing, how this potter
Ghaṭikāra, though born in a lower caste, should presume to grab me by
the hair of my freshly-washed head! This must be no ordinary matter.’
He said to Ghaṭīkāra,
‘You’d even milk it to this extent, Ghaṭīkāra?’
–
‘i
even milk it to this extent, Jotipāla. for that is how holy i regard it to
see that Blessed One.’
–
‘Well then, Ghaṭīkāra, release me, we shall go.’
Then Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the brahmin student went
to the Buddha Kassapa. Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side, but
Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one
side. Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, this is my dear friend
Jotipāla, a brahmin student. Please teach him the Dhamma.’
Then the Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and
inspired Ghaṭikāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk. Then they got up
from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa,
keeping him on their right, before leaving.
Then Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra, ‘Ghaṭīkāra, you have heard this
teaching, so why don’t you go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
–
‘Don’t you know, Jotipāla, that i look after my blind old parents?’
–
‘Well then, Ghaṭīkāra, i shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
Then Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa, bowed,
and sat down to one side. Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir,
this is my dear friend Jotipāla, a brahmin student. Please give him
the going forth.’ And Jotipāla the brahmin student received the going
forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after Jotipāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha
Kassapa—having stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he wished—set out
for Benares. Travelling stage by stage, he arrived at Benares, where he
stayed near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
The King of Kāsi heard that he had arrived. he had the finest
carriages harnessed. he then mounted a fine carriage and, along with
other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Benares to see
the Buddha Kassapa. he went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed,
then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot. he
bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.
Then the King said to the Buddha, ‘Sir, would the Buddha together
with the bhikkhu Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?’
The Buddha Kassapa consented in silence. Then, knowing that the
Buddha had consented, the King got up from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
leaving.
And when the night had passed, the King had a variety of delicious
foods prepared in his own home—soft saffron rice with the dark grains
picked out, served with many soups and sauces. Then he had the
Buddha informed of the time, saying, ‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’
Then Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his
bowl and robe, went to the home of the King, where he sat on the
seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then the King
served and satisfied the bhikkhu Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with
his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha
Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, the King took a low
seat and sat to one side. There he said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir,
may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Benares for
the rainy season. The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’
–
‘Enough, great king. I have already accepted an invitation for the rains
residence.’
For a second time … and a third time the King said to the Buddha
Kassapa, ‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside
in Benares for the rainy season. The Saṅgha will be looked after in
the same style.’
–
‘Enough, Great King. i have already accepted an
invitation for the rains residence.’
Then the King, thinking, ‘The Buddha does not accept my invitation
to reside for the rains in Benares,’ became sad and upset.
Then the King said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, do you have
another supporter better than me?’
–
‘Great king, there is a market
town named Vebhaliṅga, where there’s a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.
He is my chief supporter. Now, great king, you thought, “The Buddha
does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares,”
and you became sad and upset. But Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t get upset, nor
will he. Ghaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching,
and the Saṅgha. he doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. He
has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and has virtues praised by the noble ones. he is free of doubt
regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads
to its cessation. He eats in one part of the day; he’s celibate, virtuous,
and of good character. He has set aside gems and gold and rejected
gold and money. He’s put down the shovel and doesn’t dig the earth
with his own hands. He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank
or been dug up by mice, and brings it back in a carrier. When he has
made a pot, he says, “Anyone may leave bagged sesame, mung beans,
or chickpeas here and take what they wish.” He looks after his blind
old parents. And since he has ended the five lower fetters, Ghaṭīkāra
will be born in a heavenly realm and will become extinguished there,
not liable to return from that world.
This one time, great king, I was staying near the market town of
Vebhaliṅga. Then i robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and
robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where i said to them,
“Excuse me, where has Ghaṭīkāra gone?”
–
“Your supporter has gone
out, sir. But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”
So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.
–
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who took rice from
the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”
–
“It was the Buddha
Kassapa, my dear.”
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,
“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, in
that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much!” Then joy and happiness
did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.
Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town
of Vebhaliṅga. Then i robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl
and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where i said to
them,
“Excuse me, where has Ghaṭīkāra gone?”
–
“Your supporter has
gone out, sir. But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan
and eat.”
So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who took porridge
from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”
–
“It was the
Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,
“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, to be
trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!” Then joy and happiness did
not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.
Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town
of Vebhaliṅga. Now at that time my hut leaked. So i addressed the
bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus, go to Ghaṭikāra’s home and find some grass.”
–
When i said this, those bhikkhus said to me, “Sir, there’s no grass
there, but his workshop has a grass roof.”
–
“Then go to the workshop
and strip the grass.”
So that’s what they did. Then Ghaṭīkāra’s parents said to those
bhikkhus, “Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?”
–
“It’s the
bhikkhus, sister. The Buddha’s hut is leaking.”
–
“Take it, sirs! Take it!”
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who stripped the
grass from the workshop?”
–
“It was the bhikkhus, dear. it seems the
Buddha’s hut is leaking.”
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,
“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, to
be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!” Then joy and happiness
did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week. Then
the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three
months, but no rain fell on it. And that, great king, is what Ghaṭīkāra
the potter is like.’
‘Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate, very fortunate, to be so trusted
by the Buddha Kassapa.’
Then the King sent around five hundred cartloads of rice, soft
saffron rice, and suitable sauce to Ghaṭīkāra. Then one of the king’s
men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said, ‘Sir, these five hundred cartloads
of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce have been sent to you by
the King of Kāsī. Please accept them.’
–
‘The king has many duties, and
much to do. I have enough. Let this be for the king himself.’
Ānanda, you might think: ‘Surely the brahmin student Jotipāla must
have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not see it like
this. i was the student Jotipāla at that time.”
That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was
happy with what the Buddha said.

Being pressured by a painful feeling, he harbours aversion towards it. When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this. Being pressured by painful feeling, he seeks delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the ordinary person does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure.

And what, monks, is the right effort? (1) There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavours, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of unskilful qualities that have not yet arisen. (2) He generates desire, endeavours, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of unskilful qualities that have arisen. (3) He generates desire, endeavours, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skilful qualities that have not yet arisen. (4) He generates desire, endeavours, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, abundance, fulfilment, and development of skilful qualities that have arisen: This is called right effort.

Then a brahmin approached the Venerable Ānanda … and said: ‘for what purpose, Master Ānanda, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’

‘It is for the sake of abandoning desire, brahmin, that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’

‘But, Master Ānanda, is there a path for the abandoning of this desire?’

‘There is a path, brahmin, for the abandoning of this desire.’

‘But, Master Ānanda, what is the path for the abandoning of this desire?’

‘Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu develops the basis for potency that possesses composure due to desire and intentions of striving. He develops the basis for potency that possesses composure due to energy … composure due to mind … composure due to investigation and intentions of striving. This, brahmin, is the path for the abandoning of this desire.’

‘Such being the case, Master Ānanda, the situation is never ending. It is impossible that one can abandon desire by means of desire itself.’

‘Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter. Answer as you see fit.

What do you think, did you earlier have the desire, “I will go to the park,” and after you went to the park, did the corresponding desire subside?’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘Did you earlier arouse energy, thinking, “I will go to the park,” and after you went to the park, did the corresponding energy subside?’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘Did you earlier make up your mind, “I will go to the park,” and after you went to the park, did the corresponding resolution subside?’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘Did you earlier make an investigation, “Shall I go to the park?” and after you went to the park, did the corresponding investigation subside?’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘It is exactly the same with a bhikkhu who is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge. He earlier had the desire for the attainment of arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding desire subsided. He earlier had aroused energy for the attainment of arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding energy subsided. He earlier had made up his mind to attain arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding resolution subsided. He earlier made an investigation for the attainment of arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding investigation subsided.

What do you think, brahmin, such being the case, is the situation never-ending or is there an end?’

‘Surely, Master Ānanda, such being the case, the situation has an end, and is not never ending. Magnificent, Master Ānanda! … from today let Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower taken refuge for life.’

Any contemplatives who do not discern, as it is, the gratification of sensuality as gratification, the danger of sensuality as danger, the escape from sensuality as escape: that they themselves would understand sensuality; or would rouse another with the truth so that, in line with what he has practised, he would understand sensuality: that is impossible.

… Then Ānanda said to the nun:

‘Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food. This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving. This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit. This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.

“This body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food.” This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a bhikkhu who concurrently reflects on the food that they eat (while they eat): “Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the holy life. In this way, I shall put an end to old feelings and not give rise to new feelings, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.” After some time, relying on food, they give up food. That’s why I said what I said.

“This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving.” This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a bhikkhu who hears this: “They say that the bhikkhu named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” They think: “Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …” After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving. That’s why I said what I said.

“This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit.” This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a bhikkhu who hears this: “They say that the bhikkhu named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” They think: “Well, that venerable person can realize the undefiled freedom of mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. … Why can’t I?” After some time, relying on conceit, they give up conceit. That’s why I said what I said.

“This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.”’

Bhikkhus, this is said: ‘A first point of ignorance, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no ignorance and afterward it came into being.’ Still, ignorance is seen to have a specific condition.

I say, bhikkhus, that ignorance has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for ignorance? It should be said: the five hindrances.

The five hindrances, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances? It should be said: the three kinds of misconduct.

The three kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct? It should be said: non-restraint of the sense faculties.

Non-restraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for non-restraint of the sense faculties? It should be said: lack of recollection and awareness.

Lack of recollection and awareness, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of recollection and awareness? It should be said: no concurrent attention.

No concurrent attention too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for no concurrent attention? It should be said: lack of trust.

Lack of trust, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of trust? It should be said: not hearing the good Dhamma.

Not hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: not associating with good people.
